# rock-paper-scissors

This is my first JavaScript project from The Odin Project's Web Development 101 class. The project consists of making a rock-paper-scissors game fully playable. First comes the JavaScript portion and later I will add a frontend to the project. 

This doesn't look too complicated at first. I already have some experience coding on Python so it shouldn't be too hard.
